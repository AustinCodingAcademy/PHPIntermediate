02 - Functions, Arrays & Strings
----------------------------
>Now that we have the basics out of the way, we will be looking at functions in greater detail.
>Encapsulating our procedural style code, into reusable units, is arguably one of the most important concepts in programming.
>Arrays are one of the most useful and handy data structures that you will use almost every day in your life as a developer.
>String manipulation is an important skill. We will become familiar with strings, searching through them, checking if a 
value is in a string, replacing values, formatting etc... With over 90 native functions, we will have plenty to keep us busy!

### Functions
* Creating a function
* Arguments
* Type hinting and ensuring argument types
* Setting default values i.e. overriding arguments
* Distinction between 'by value' and 'by reference' arguments
* Returning values
* Documenting the entire method
* Variable scope within a function
* Throwing exceptions
* Variable length arguments with [func_get_args()](http://us3.php.net/manual/en/function.func-get-args.php)

### Arrays
* How to create an array
* Basic array operations i.e. adding/removing/replacing values
* Referencing values in an array
* Looping through an array
* Creating a hash table for fast index lookups
* Sorting arrays

### Strings
* Creating a string
* Concatenating two strings
* Concatenating mixed types
* Escaping literal values
* Referencing individual characters using array notation
* Simple string search
* Formatting strings and numbers
