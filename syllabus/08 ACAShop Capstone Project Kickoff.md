ACAShop - Capstone Project Kickoff
=======================
For our capstone project, we will be building an online store! Here some of the functionality we expect our store to have.

* Create an attractive homepage, using [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), complete with a logo, login module and navigation links
* Create an administrative area that will allow us to add and edit products in our online catalog.
* Display all products we have for sale
* Create a shopping cart. The cart should allow the user to remove items, and update quantities.
* Allow users to create an account, or checkout as a guest
* Users can create an account before they checkout or during checkout.
* Users can login at any time to view a list of all orders they have purchased.
* Users can also update their personal information, shipping and billing addresses.
* After the user checks out, show a confirmation page with details about the order they just created.
* Create a simple sales report, showing what our sales numbers look like over time.

You have two choices for this particular project.
You can either be a lone ranger and work on it yourself, or you can pair up with another person.
If you do choose to pair up, we can help you structure your work so its more atomic and create a branch for you,
