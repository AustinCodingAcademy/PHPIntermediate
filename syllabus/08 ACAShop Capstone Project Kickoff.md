ACAShop - Capstone Project Kickoff
=======================
For our capstone project, we will be building an online store! Here some of the functionality we expect our store to have.

* Create an attractive homepage, using [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), complete with a logo, login module and navigation links
* Create an administrative area that will allow us to add and edit products in our online catalog.
* Display all products we have for sale
* Create a shopping cart. The cart should allow the user to remove items, and update quantities.
* Allow user's to create an account, or checkout as a guest
* User's can create an account before they checkout or during checkout.
* User's can login at any time to view a list of all orders they have purchased.
* User's can also update their personal information, shipping and billing addresses.
* After the user checks out, show a confirmation page with details about the order they just created.
* Create a simple sales report, showing what our sales numbers look like over time.
