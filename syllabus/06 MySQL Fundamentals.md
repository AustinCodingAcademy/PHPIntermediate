MySQL Fundamentals
==================
>[MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) is "The world's most popular open source database".
It's fast, secure, scalable, ACID compliant and built to handle high intensity web workloads.
The language of MySQL, and most other relational databases, is SQL.
SQL is an expressive language that we will use to ask the database questions about our data.
Our question is known as a query, and the data we get back is called a result set.

***

### Terminology
A database is a collection of tables. A table is a collection of fields that can hold certain kinds of data.
Think of a table as an excel spreadsheet. Each column has a heading, and each row contains values for each of those headings.
A table in MySQL has different data types.
Setting the data type and data length on fields dictates the type data the field can contain.

#### Create a new table
Here is an example of using ```CREATE TABLE``` to create a new table, if one with the same name doesn't already exist.
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `product` (
  `product_id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `product_name` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
  `product_description` text,
  `product_price` float(5,2) DEFAULT NULL,
  `category` varchar(50) DEFAULT NULL,
  `tags` varchar(100) DEFAULT NULL,
  `date_time_added` datetime DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`product_id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8
```

#### Inserting records
Once we have created a table, we can ```INSERT``` some data into it.
```sql
INSERT INTO `product`
    (product_name, product_description, product_price, category, tags, date_time_added)
VALUES
    ("Nike Shox", "Awesome running shoes", 56.99, "Running Shoes", "shoes, running, footwear", NOW());
```

Lets insert one more product, to keep things interesting.
```sql
INSERT INTO `product`
    (product_name, product_description, product_price, category, tags, date_time_added)
VALUES
    ("Nike Elite Crew", "Really comfortable socks", 7.97, "Athletic Socks", "socks, running, footwear", NOW());
```

#### Selecting records
Our product table now contains two records that we can retrieve by issuing a ```SELECT```
```sql
SELECT * FROM product;
```

```
+------------+-----------------+--------------------------+---------------+----------------+--------------------------+---------------------+
| product_id | product_name    | product_description      | product_price | category       | tags                     | date_time_added     |
+------------+-----------------+--------------------------+---------------+----------------+--------------------------+---------------------+
|          1 | Nike Shox       | Awesome running shoes    |         56.99 | Running Shoes  | shoes, running, footwear | 2014-10-09 13:07:52 |
|          2 | Nike Elite Crew | Really comfortable socks |          7.97 | Athletic Socks | socks, running, footwear | 2014-10-09 13:23:54 |
+------------+-----------------+--------------------------+---------------+----------------+--------------------------+---------------------+
```

Notice the first field ```product_id```. MySQL automatically assigned an incrementing integer value to this field.
This field is what is known as an auto increment primary key. Every table should contain a primary key, unless you have a really good performance reason to not do so.
A primary key is unique, and is typically automatically generated by the database.
There are some instances where you would want to generate a primary key based on some user criteria.
We will not get into that as it relates to [Sharding](http://www.slideshare.net/mkindahl/mysql-sharding-tools-and-best-practices-for-horizontal-scaling),
which is the practice of horizontally scaling the table out to multiple servers to scale write capacity.

```SELECT``` statements can also filter data using the ```WHERE``` clause.

#### Simple queries
 Find all products that are in the "Running Shoes" category
 ```sql
 SELECT * FROM product WHERE category = "Running Shoes";
 ```

 Find all products that are cheaper than $60
 ```sql
 SELECT * FROM product WHERE product_price < 60;
 ```

 Find all products that are tagged with "footwear".
 ```sql
 SELECT * FROM product WHERE tags LIKE "%footwear%";
 ```

Find all products that were added on 09/10/2014
```sql
SELECT * FROM product WHERE DATE(date_time_added) = "2014-10-09";
```

Create a list of just product names and prices with the $ symbol added to the price. Also sort by product name in ascending order.
```sql
SELECT
    product_name as name,
    CONCAT('$', '', product_price) as price
FROM
    product
ORDER BY
    product_name ASC
```

```
+-----------------+--------+
| name            | price  |
+-----------------+--------+
| Nike Elite Crew | $7.97  |
| Nike Shox       | $56.99 |
+-----------------+--------+
```

#### Aggregate queries
Count the number of products we sell
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as num_products FROM product;
```

What is the minimum, maximum and average price of our products.
```sql
SELECT
    MIN(product_price) as min_price,
    MAX(product_price) as max_price,
    AVG(product_price) as avg_price
FROM
    product
```

```
+-----------+-----------+-----------+
| min_price | max_price | avg_price |
+-----------+-----------+-----------+
|      7.97 |     56.99 | 32.480001 |
+-----------+-----------+-----------+
```

### Joins
Joining tables involves merging two or more data sets on a certain criteria to produce a result. 
The best way to explain this idea is with an example. Consider the ```product``` table that we just created. 
This table has a field called ```category``` 
```sql
`category` varchar(50) DEFAULT NULL
```
As you can see, this field contains textual values. 
As we continue to add more products, we would need to enter textual values for each new category. 
In our current implementation, this is a perfectly valid solution, but as our table grows, it will soon become an inefficient strategy.

#### Creating a category table
A superior solution would be to create another table that contains all our product categories. 
In this way, we can simply assign each product a category. 
```sql
CREATE TABLE `category` (
  `category_id` int(11) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `category_name` varchar(50) DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`category_id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;
```

Lets insert our product categories in our table.
```sql
INSERT INTO `category` (`category_name`) VALUES ('Running Shoes');
INSERT INTO `category` (`category_name`) VALUES ('Athletic Socks');
```

Our category table now contains two records
```sql
SELECT * FROM category;
```

```
+-------------+----------------+
| category_id | category_name  |
+-------------+----------------+
|           1 | Running Shoes  |
|           2 | Athletic Socks |
+-------------+----------------+
```

#### Modifying product table
Lets modify our ```product``` table to use this new ```category_id``` in place of our old ```category``` name field.
```sql
ALTER TABLE `product` ADD `category_id` INT  NULL  DEFAULT NULL  AFTER `category`;
```

#### Update a value in the product table
Update the ```product``` table with the appropriate ```category_id```s.
```sql
UPDATE `product` SET `category_id` = '1' WHERE `product_id` = '1';
UPDATE `product` SET `category_id` = '2' WHERE `product_id` = '2';
```

#### Remove an existing field from the product table
Get rid of, i.e. ```DROP```, the existing ```category``` field.
```sql
ALTER TABLE `product` DROP `category`;
```

Now lets take a look at the contents of our ```product``` table by issuing a ```SELECT```
```sql
SELECT * FROM product;
```

```
+------------+-----------------+--------------------------+---------------+-------------+--------------------------+---------------------+
| product_id | product_name    | product_description      | product_price | category_id | tags                     | date_time_added     |
+------------+-----------------+--------------------------+---------------+-------------+--------------------------+---------------------+
|          1 | Nike Shox       | Awesome running shoes    |         56.99 |           1 | shoes, running, footwear | 2014-11-12 17:12:54 |
|          2 | Nike Elite Crew | Really comfortable socks |          7.97 |           2 | socks, running, footwear | 2014-11-12 17:13:00 |
+------------+-----------------+--------------------------+---------------+-------------+--------------------------+---------------------+
```
Notice how we now have a ```category_id``` in place of ```category```. 

#### Select specific fields
Let's issue a ```SELECT``` query to only show a subset of the fields in the ```product``` table
```sql
SELECT product_id, product_name, category_id FROM product;
```

```
+------------+-----------------+-------------+
| product_id | product_name    | category_id |
+------------+-----------------+-------------+
|          1 | Nike Shox       |           1 |
|          2 | Nike Elite Crew |           2 |
+------------+-----------------+-------------+
```

What we are interested in doing is getting the ```category_name``` that each product belongs to. 
In order to do that, we will join in the ```category``` table on ```category_id```. 
The ```ON``` clause refers to a **foreign** key in the table that you are joining in. 

Here is how you would do it. 
```sql
SELECT 
	p.product_id, 
	p.product_name, 
	p.category_id,
	c.category_name
FROM 
	product AS p
	LEFT JOIN category c ON (c.category_id = p.category_id);
```

The first thing to notice is that we aliased ```product``` and ```category``` as ```p``` and ```c``` respectively.  
This is because we need to let the database know, which data set the fields we are selecting come from. 
Next up is the join. We are joining the ```category``` table ```ON``` the ```category_id``` field. 
The ```category_id``` field is a *foreign key* on the ```product``` table and a *primary key* on the ```category``` table. 

This is what your ouput looks like 
```
+------------+-----------------+-------------+----------------+
| product_id | product_name    | category_id | category_name  |
+------------+-----------------+-------------+----------------+
|          1 | Nike Shox       |           1 | Running Shoes  |
|          2 | Nike Elite Crew |           2 | Athletic Socks |
+------------+-----------------+-------------+----------------+
```
