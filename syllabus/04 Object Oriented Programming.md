Object Oriented Programming
===============
>PHP5 is an enterprise grade object oriented programming language. This week, we will be looking at how to build classes
that we will later use, at runtime, to instantiate objects. Instantiated objects can take on different forms, depending
on the context in which they were created.
>In writing some OO code we will briefly delve into some design patterns.

***

### OOP Fundamentals
* Creating a class
* Instantiating an object
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism

### Classes explained
* Constructors, arguments and overloading
* Public, private and protected methods
* Class constants
* Static methods
* Static properties
* The $this keyword
* How to access object properties

### Abstract Classes & Interfaces
* What is an abstract class?
* What is an interface?
* Whats the difference?
* What can we use this for?

### Exceptions revisited
* Base Exception class
* Overriding Exception by extending
* Why would we want to override the base Exception class?
* How to throw your own Exceptions and why it matters

### Design Patterns
* Factory
* Singleton
* Front Controller
* Model View Controller
