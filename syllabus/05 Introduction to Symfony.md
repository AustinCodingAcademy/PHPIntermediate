Introduction to Symfony
=======================
>Now that we are comfortable with Object Oriented Programming, we will start learning about the [Symfony](http://symfony.com/) web framework. 
>The reason why we are looking at this framework instead of another is because it's modern and has all the features we could ever need. 
>It's fast, easy to set up, supports Composer, MVC, Front Controller, YML Configuration, Service Container, Dependency Injection etc...
