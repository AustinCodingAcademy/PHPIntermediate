=======================
>Now that we are comfortable with [Object Oriented Programming](syllabus/04 Object Oriented Programming.md), we will start looking at

>The reason why we are looking at this framework instead of another is because it has all the features that we need to help us build our application; 
>it's fast, easy to set up, supports composer, MVC with front controller, loosely coupled architecture etc...
