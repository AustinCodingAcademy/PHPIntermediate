09 - Composer
===============
> Composer is a popular and widely used package manager for PHP

In order to use composer you will require a composer.json file in the directory you would like to install packages in.
Note that all these commands should be run *after* you SSH into the VM.
 
A sample `composer.json` file looks like this
```json
{
    "name": "myGithubUsername/myGithubRepoName",
    "authors": [
        {
            "name": "Samir Patel",
            "email": "samir@austincodingacademy.com"
        }
    ],
    "require": {
        "facebook/php-sdk-v4": "~5.0"
    }
}
```
The main thing to focus on here are the contents of the ```require``` section. 
In this section you will define all the dependencies you require with a version constraint. 

You can find packages on [Packagist.com](http://packagist.com). 
The ```~``` operator in this case means all packages that are version `5.x.x` but less than `6.0.0`. 
Package versions are created by creatig a git tag with the format `vxMaj.xMin.xPat` 
where `xMaj` is the major version, `xMin` is the minor version and `xPat` is the patch. 
This convention of versioning software is standard across the industry and is explained in detail [here](http://semver.org)

#### Install Composer
If you don't have composer installed on your machine you can run the following command to install it.
```bash
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
```

This command will download a file called `composer.phar` in the same directory. 
A `.phar` file is a PHP executable i.e. it is a standalone PHP application like an `exe` or `app` on windows and a mac respectively. 

You can execute the archive by issuing the following command
```bash
php composer.phar
```

You should see some output that looks like this
```bash
   ______
  / ____/___  ____ ___  ____  ____  ________  _____
 / /   / __ \/ __ `__ \/ __ \/ __ \/ ___/ _ \/ ___/
/ /___/ /_/ / / / / / / /_/ / /_/ (__  )  __/ /
\____/\____/_/ /_/ /_/ .___/\____/____/\___/_/
                    /_/

```

Ideally, you want your composer.phar executable to be available systemwide. 
In your VM if you moved an executable to `/usr/local/bin` it will be available systemwide, for the user that you are currently logged in as.

Issue the following command to make composer availble to you systemwide
```bash
mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
```

Now you can type `composer` anywhere in order to execute the composer application.  

#### Install packages using composer
In order to install the packages mentioned in `composer.json` issue the following command
```bash
composer install -vvv
```

The `-vvv` flag stands for very very verbose. Adding this switch will display detailed output informing you of composer's every move.
Once this process has finished you will observe that a new directory called `vendor` has been created. Inside this folder you should see a PHP file called `autoload.php`

#### Using the package(s)
In order to use your newly installed packages you will need to require this file in your code, as such.

*index.php*
```php
<?php
require('vendor/autoload.php');

// Now use the package(s)
```

In order to use a vendor package it is essential that you understand what namespaces are and how they work. 
Fortunately that is the subject of discussion in the following section.
