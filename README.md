> This course is designed for students with a fundamental understanding of programming. 
> We will spend some time reviewing PHP basics, for those students who are familiar with another language but not PHP.
> Student's who are familiar with PHP will benefit from a refresher.
> We will then move on to commonly used linguistic constructs, talk about the web, study the object oriented paradigm, 
learn about some of the most commonly used design patterns and learn Symfony, a widely used PHP framework.
> We will then spend the rest of the class working on a project, which will ultimately become a part of our portfolio.
