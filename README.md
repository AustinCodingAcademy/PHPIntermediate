> This course is designed for students with a fundamental understanding of programming. 
> We will spend some time reviewing PHP basics, for students who are familiar with another language.
> We will then move on to commonly used linguistic constructs, talk about the web, learn Object Oriented principles,
apply some commonly used design patterns, learn about the MySQL database server and learn the Symfony Full 
> We will then spend the rest of the class working on a project, which will ultimately become a part of our portfolio.
