> This course is designed for students with a fundamental understanding of programming. 
> We will spend some time reviewing PHP basics, for students who are familiar with another language.
> We will then move on to commonly used linguistic constructs, talk about the web, learn Object Oriented principles,
apply some of the most commonly used design patterns, learn about the MySQL database server and learn Symfony.
> We will then spend the rest of the class working on a project, which will ultimately become a part of our portfolio.

#### Book
Although you are not required to purchase a book for this class, I strongly recommend you do.
The cookbook includes solutions to lots of common problems and is great for quickly referencing a working example on most web and CLI related topics in PHP.
